# CollisionHandling
Hello guys!
this is my simple collision test project for monogame.
Feel free to use the code for whatever you want. Credits would be welcome, but are not necessary.

I tried to implement much more shapes in the later development. Currently it have circle=circle and circle=line collision. It can generate the outlines from an int collision array too.

If some one needs a simple 2d camera, you will find one here too :D

I opened a thread here, if someone has a good solustion for the bugs or the missing implementations.

The devel (and the next master) based on the great SharpMath2-Library from Timothy Moore
